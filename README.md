CodeBook.md - This code book describes the data, variables, any transformations and detailed process I followed in order to create this R script.

run_analysis.R  - The R scripts are the codes that performs the data preparation and followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
